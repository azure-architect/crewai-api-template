I've reviewed your progress on the CrewAI integration with Gemini LLM. It looks like you've made excellent headway by leveraging the built-in liteLLM support rather than implementing a custom solution.

Let's focus on completing the remaining tasks:

### 1. Commit and push changes to GitHub

Now that you have your SSH key set up, you can commit and push your changes. Here's a suggested process:

```bash
# Stage your changes
git add .

# Create a commit with a descriptive message
git commit -m "Fix Gemini LLM integration using built-in liteLLM support

- Replaced custom Gemini implementation with proper liteLLM formatting
- Added environment variable handling for API keys
- Ensured compatibility with both Ollama and Gemini providers
- Updated documentation with usage examples"

# Push to your repository
git push origin main  # or your branch name
```

### 2. Testing the integration

Before or after pushing, you should verify the integration works correctly:

```python
import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew, LLM
from dotenv import load_dotenv

# Load API key from .env file
load_dotenv()

# Create the LLM (no need to specify provider since format handles it)
gemini_llm = LLM(model="gemini/gemini-1.5-pro", temperature=0.7)

# Simple test task
test_agent = Agent(
    role="Tester",
    goal="Verify Gemini integration works",
    backstory="You test systems to ensure they function correctly",
    llm=gemini_llm,
)

test_task = Task(
    description="Respond with a simple confirmation that you're running on Gemini",
    agent=test_agent
)

crew = Crew(agents=[test_agent], tasks=[test_task])
result = crew.kickoff()

print(result)
```

### 3. Documentation for team reference

Let's create a clear documentation snippet for your team:

```markdown
# CrewAI Gemini LLM Integration

## Overview
CrewAI supports Gemini models through its built-in liteLLM integration. No custom implementation is needed.

## Setup

1. Set your Google API key as an environment variable:
   ```python
   # Option 1: Direct in code (not recommended for production)
   import os
   os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = "your_api_key_here"
   
   # Option 2: Using dotenv (recommended)
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   load_dotenv()  # loads GOOGLE_API_KEY from .env file
   ```

2. Create the LLM instance with the proper format:
   ```python
   from crewai import LLM
   
   gemini_llm = LLM(model="gemini/gemini-1.5-pro", temperature=0.7)
   ```
   
   Note: The format "gemini/{model_name}" is crucial - this tells liteLLM to use the Gemini provider.

3. Use with agents as normal:
   ```python
   from crewai import Agent
   
   agent = Agent(
       role="Example Agent",
       goal="Demonstrate Gemini integration",
       backstory="You help teams integrate with AI models",
       llm=gemini_llm,
   )
   ```

## Supported Models
- gemini/gemini-1.5-flash
- gemini/gemini-1.5-pro
- gemini/gemini-pro

## Tips
- For production use, always store API keys in environment variables or secrets management
- Adjust temperature and other parameters as needed for your use case
```

Do you need any help with specific aspects of the implementation or would you like me to elaborate on any part of this plan?
